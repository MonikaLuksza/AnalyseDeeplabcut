MAIN.PY


WRIST_DISTANCE.PY
This code can be used to determine the wrist rotation during reaching. The output is a csv file with x and y distances of points on the used wrist during reaching and the x and y distances of knuckles points on the used hand. 
The angle was determined by using the dot product for magnitude and cross product for direction of two 2D vectors. In future, change the function calculate_rotation_angle into computation of angle using 3D vectors. 

SUCCESS_RATE.PY
This can be used to plot two figures about the success and failure, using the correct yaml folder. The first plot represents the number of successfull trials, seperated into right versus left hand and the four different orientations. 
The second plot represents the rate of successful trials to unsuccessful trials, seperated into right and left hand, and the different orientations. If there are no successful trials, the ratio will be 0. 

UI_INPUTS.PY
The user interface while running the codes is generated by this code. Change the default paths of the project and task data if their folder location changes. 

CHARUCO_BOARD_CREATION.PY
If a different board is needed for camera calibration, it can be generated using this code. The parameters, such as number of squares and size, can be modified:

If the charuco board changes, the picture in the anipose folder must match the new board. The config.toml file must also be updated with the new parameters, in the section [calibration].
