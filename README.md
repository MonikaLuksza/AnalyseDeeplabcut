Whenever using the code, make sure to git pull first. If no folder yet exist, use git clone and the HTTP link to repository. Aternatively, you can also copy paste the code into VS_Code, while making sure to install the python extension and installing the needed librairies.

MAIN.PY
The trajectory_one_movement gives a csv file as output, which gives the distance of movement, its speed, acceleration and jerk of movement. 
The grasp_distance gives as output two csv files, one with the distance between digits during reaching throughout time, one with the angle of the digits (using Jindex, Jthumb and both thumb and wrist).
Make sure to comment the other function.

If the camera (digger) and the trials (koala) did not start at the same time, add the delay (in seconds) to the timeBeginningMovement in lines 113, 240.

WRIST_DISTANCE.PY
This code can be used to determine the wrist rotation during reaching. The output is a csv file with x and y distances of points on the used wrist during reaching and the x and y distances of knuckles points on the used hand. 
The angle was determined by using the dot product for magnitude and cross product for direction of two 2D vectors. In future, change the function calculate_rotation_angle into computation of angle using 3D vectors. 

SUCCESS_RATE.PY
This can be used to plot two figures about the success and failure, using the correct yaml folder. The first plot represents the number of successfull trials, seperated into right versus left hand and the four different orientations. 
The second plot represents the rate of successful trials to unsuccessful trials, seperated into right and left hand, and the different orientations. If there are no successful trials, the ratio will be 0. 

UI_INPUTS.PY
The user interface while running the codes is generated by this code. Change the default paths of the project and task data if their folder location changes. 

CHARUCO_BOARD_CREATION.PY
If a different board is needed for camera calibration, it can be generated using this code. The parameters, such as number of squares and size, can be modified:

If the charuco board changes, the picture in the anipose folder must match the new board. The config.toml file must also be updated with the new parameters, in the section [calibration].
